After Completing all the required installments and the changes head over to Uptime Robot [here](https://uptimerobot.com/) and login there..Choose the monitor as `https`.Then you would need a link..You could get the link in the web section of you project..First time if you dont run the project you could not see that section.Run the project and you could see it.Then paste the link in uptime robot and take any name and click monitor..And your project will be online 24/7..
